/* FIXME: Fix cache issues, and rewrite to use curses.
 *
 * The  current  way  that this is required to be implemented is that  it  loops
 * through tiles left to right, top to bottom, left to right. In order for it to
 * be  able to render without the cursor moving,  it needs to loop through every
 * horizontal  tile (on a row)  and position within for every vertical tile  and
 * position within. To my knowledge of computers, they don't like it when you do
 * this, and thus it needs to be rewritten.
 *
 * Also, it should also look better with curses because of colors.
